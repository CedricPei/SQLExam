You are an **Constraint Extractor** in an LLM-based SQL-evaluation pipeline.

### Inputs
- `SCHEMA`: database schema (text)
- `QUESTION`: user's natural-language question
- `BACKGROUND` : helpful hints for the question
- `GOLD_SQL`: gold-standard SQL query

### Task
1. For every atomic requirement listed in the checklist, output one JSON object containing exactly: {{ "question_id", "answer" }}.
    - `question_id`: the numbering string from the checklist (e.g. "2.3").  
    - `answer`: concrete value(s) you extract (string or JSON array).  
    - If the requirement does not apply to the question, set `"answer": "NA"`.

2. Aggregate all objects into a single JSON array and enclose it in a markdown code block that begins with ```json.

### Rules
- Prioritize the question and schema; use GOLD_SQL only as a supplementary reference, ignoring any elements it includes but are not necessary.
- **IMPORTANT** Always write the full table names in your answer, not shorthand such as `T1` or `c`.
- One object per atomic requirement; no missing question_ids.  
- Keep answers concise; use arrays when multiple values apply.  
- Never add extra keys or change key names.

######  Instructions
For each checklist item below, output **one** JSON object with exactly:
- "question_id": the item's identifier (e.g., "2").
- "answer": the extracted value(s).
    - Use a JSON array if multiple values apply.  
    - If the requirement does not apply, set "answer": "NA".
    - Do NOT use table aliases in your answerâ€”always write full table names.

**IMPORTANT** Extract only information that the user has explicitly required or is mandatory for answering the question.
**IMPORTANT: TREAT GOLD_SQL AS REFERENCE ONLY**, ignore any operation it contains that the user did not request (e.g., extra aliases or formatting).

After completing all items, aggregate the objects into a **single JSON array** and enclose it in a markdown code block that begins with ```json.  

######  CHECKLIST BEGIN

1. List NECESSARY tables the answer MUST reference and that MUST appear in the provided schema.

2. List each NECESSARY join that is STRICTLY REQUIRED to answer the question.
    - Consider `JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`, `INNER JOIN`, `OUTER JOIN`, `NATURAL JOIN`, `SELF JOIN`.
    - Record both the join type and the join keys.
    - Example: `orders INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id`.

3. List NECESSARY columns the answer MUST reveal and that MUST appear in the provided schema.  
    - Express each column in fully-qualified `table.column` form; DO NOT output bare column names.
    - For ambiguous questions, include only the minimal column(s) needed.
        - for "Which/What <Entity>?" query, return either id or name (not both).
    - If all columns of one table are required, use `table.*`.
    - Consider all columns in the SQL query.

4. List NECESSARY row-level filters or limits STRICTLY REQUIRED to answer the question.  
    - Consider `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT/FETCH FIRST`, `OFFSET`, `NULLS FIRST`, `NULLS LAST`.
    - Consider sub-query predicates such as `EXISTS` or `NOT EXISTS`.

5. List each NECESSARY `GROUP-BY-HAVING` clause STRICTLY REQUIRED to answer the question.

6. List NECESSARY aggregate functions that the query MUST call
    - `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `STDDEV`, `VAR_SAMP`, `VARIANCE`.  
    - `GROUP_CONCAT` / `STRING_AGG`, `BOOL_AND`, `BOOL_OR`, `JSON_AGG`, `ARRAY_AGG`, `MEDIAN`, `PERCENTILE_CONT`, `PERCENTILE_DISC`.

7. List columns the user EXPLICITLY REQUIRES to have unique values.
    - DO NOT include columns that are unique merely because they are primary keys.
    - List only those the question explicitly asks to be distinct.

8. List output aliases the user EXPLICITLY REQUESTS.
    - DO NOT include aliases that appear in GOLD_SQL but are not required.
