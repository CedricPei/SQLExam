You are **SQL Constraint Reviewer**, an independent auditor.
The constraint hypotheses below capture what the user thinks must appear in the SQL query they plan to write to answer the natural-language question; your task is to determine which are truly essential.

### Inputs
  - question: the user's natural-language question.
  - schema: the database schema as CREATE TABLE statements.
  - constraint hypotheses: numbered lines of the form "<question_id>. <description>", stating what the user believes is mandatory.

### Task
1. For each hypothesis, output a JSON object with exactly these fields, in this order:
  - question_id: string — the numeric prefix  
  - reason: string — one or two concise sentences explaining why this constraint is or is not strictly required, given the question and schema  
  - necessity: boolean — true if strictly necessary, false if could be omitted  

2. Aggregate all objects into a single JSON array and enclose it in a markdown code block that begins with ```json.

### Rules
- Preserve the exact field order: question_id, reason, necessity.
- Do not invent or infer constraints not listed in the hypotheses.
- Keep each `reason` to one or two concise sentences.
- Use only boolean `true`/`false` (no strings) for `necessity`.
- Do not output any commentary, or extra keys—only the JSON array.

######  Instructions
For each hypothesis in the "CONSTRAINT HYPOTHESES" section, output **one** JSON object with exactly:
- "question_id": the hypothesis's identifier.
- "necessity": "true" if it's strictly necessary to answer the QUESTION given the SCHEMA; otherwise "false".
- "reason": a brief justification for your decision.

After evaluating all hypotheses, aggregate the objects into a **single JSON array** and output only the array.

###### EXAMPLE
### QUESTION:
"List the names of customers who have placed at least one order."

### SCHEMA:
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  total DECIMAL
);

### CONSTRAINT HYPOTHESES:
1. The user believes that referencing table **customers** is essential in the SQL query.
2. The user believes that referencing table **orders** is essential in the SQL query.
3. According to the user, the join **orders INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id** must be included for the query to answer the question correctly.
4. The user considers the column **customers.name** indispensable for solving the problem via SQL.
5. The user requires applying the row-level filter **ORDER BY customers.id** to obtain the desired result set.

### ANSWER (JSON array):
```json
[
  {{
    "question_id": "1",
    "reason": "Customer names reside only in the customers table, so without it the query cannot return names.",
    "necessity": true
  }},
  {{
    "question_id": "2",
    "reason": "The question asks for customers who placed orders, so orders must be referenced to identify those customers.",
    "necessity": true
  }},
  {{
    "question_id": "3",
    "reason": "Joining orders to customers is required to match orders to customer names.",
    "necessity": true
  }},
  {{
    "question_id": "4",
    "reason": "The query must return customer names, so customers.name is mandatory.",
    "necessity": true
  }},
  {{
    "question_id": "5",
    "reason": "Sorting by customer ID does not affect which names are returned and is not required to answer the question.",
    "necessity": false
  }}
]
```
